    "#### Morphological Operation\n",
    "##### Morphological operations are image processing techniques used to modify the shape of objects in an image.\n",
    "##### Types are:\n",
    "##### 1. Erosion\n",
    "-Removes pixels from the boundaries of objects.\n",
    "##### Syntax \n",
    "-          eroded = cv2.erode(img, kernel, iterations=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Dilations\n",
    "-Adds pixels to object boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax\n",
    "-  dilated = cv2.dilate(img, kernel, iterations=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Opening\n",
    "-Erosion followed by Dilation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax\n",
    "-opening = cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)\n",

    "##### 4. Closing\n",
    "-Dilation followed by Erosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax\n",

    "##### 5. Morphological Gradient\n",
    "##### Morphological Gradient is an operation used to detect the boundary(edge) of objects in an image. It highlights the difference between dilation and erosion of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax:\n",
    "- gradient = cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_GRADIENT, kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Top-HAt Transformation\n",
    "##### Top-Hat is a morphological operation used to extract small bright objects from a dark background. It highlights details that are brighter than their surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax:\n",
    "- cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_TOPHAT, kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. Black-Hat Transformation\n",
    "##### Black-Hat is a morphological operation used to extract small dark objects from a bright background. It highlights details that are darker tha their surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax \n",
    "- blackhat = cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_BLACKHAT, kernel)"
